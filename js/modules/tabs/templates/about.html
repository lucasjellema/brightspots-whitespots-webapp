                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Brightspots & Whitespots Dashboard is a tool designed to visualize and analyze survey data regarding perceived upcoming trends, technologies and customer challenges and requests for help. 
                        It helps us identify both areas of strength ("brightspots") and opportunities for improvement ("whitespots") 
                        in technology adoption, customer challenges, and emerging trends.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Survey Methodology</h3>
                    <p>
                        The underlying survey collects data from various companies and professionals across our ecosystem to understand:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Key customer challenges and pain points as observed at customers</li>
                        <li>Emerging technology adoption patterns</li>
                        <li>Technology trends and vendor landscape</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>What are "Brightspots"?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Brightspots represent areas where our ecosystem of expert companies provides a service portfolio to match the customer demand. 
                        These are opportunities where our sales organization can leverage existing propositions and delivery strengths and knowledge.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>What are "Whitespots"?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Whitespots are areas of customer demand or emerging opportunities where we currently do not have the existing offerings or even enough clear roadmap and ambition to meet the (upcoming) customer demand. 
                        These are areas where organizations might want to focus their innovation efforts or learning initiatives.
                    </p>
